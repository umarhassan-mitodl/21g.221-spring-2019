**Introduction**: "Small talk," informal chatting with strangers or acquaintances, can be a major source of anxiety for many, regardless of cultural background. At the same time, graceful small talk is a valuable (even necessary) skill in most Anglo-American professional contexts and can help you network to build useful relationships.

**Task #1**: Watch the video _Get That Job: Making Small Talk_. Take notes and be prepared to deliver a 90-second summary of what you learned.

**Task #2**: Discuss which topics below are appropriate for small talk in the USA:

*   Religion
*   Sports
*   Salary
*   Weather
*   Politics
*   TV shows/Movies
*   Marital status
*   Personal health
*   Health problems
*   Physical appearance
*   Taste in music

How can we reconcile anxiety and necessity? First, we can **prepare content** for the informal banter that characterizes contexts like work parties, conference events, and job interviews by activities such as

*   Reading (e.g., MIT's student newspaper, _The Tech_; local, national, and world news in Anglo-American sources; local and company websites)
*   Keeping up with the local national sports scenes
*   Other?

Second, we can adopt appropriate **networking behaviors** for social contexts:

*   Move around and approach small groups rather than large ones
*   Introduce ourselves and remember other people's names
*   Be sensitive to others' verbal and physical **exit** cues; use our own tactfully
*   Take a sincere interest in others; find common ground
*   Listen more than we speak; listen actively
*   Ask open-ended questions and expand in your responses to others' yes/no questions
*   Display _open_ body language
*   Keep our tone and conversation positive; avoid the negative
*   Avoid eating and drinking too much

**Task #3**: Work with a partner to compose a short small talk exchange between two MIT students meeting at the ISO orientation. Try to combine statements and questions into a turn-taking exchange. The start is provided for you.

A: Hi, how are you?

B: Hi, good thanks. Happy to finally be here! Did you just arrive?

**Task #4**: Work with a partner to compose a short small talk exchange between an interviewer and an interviewee at the start of a job interview.
